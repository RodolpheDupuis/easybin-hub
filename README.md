# Easybin

Personal HUB Project developed during our 3rd year at EPITECH

## Project overview:

Easybin is a mobile app aimed to facilitate the selective sorting of everyday products.  
It uses a simple scanning system (similar to Yuka) that gives you all the required information about the chosen product.  

The databse provides a basic set of items and every user can register new items to the database, that can later be scanned by other users.  
The app is very easy to use and is composed of 3 main pages:  
* The *Scan* page, where you can scan the products that you want information about.  
* The *Add* page, where you can add a missing product to the EasyBin databse.  
* The *Profile* page, where you can see the history of your scanned products and some stats.  

## Technical overview:  
This repository contains everything related to Easybin, you will find both the app and the server source codes.   
The app was developped in **React native** using **expo**, for the barcode scan it uses the free `expo-barcode-scanner` library.  
The api was developped in **Ruby On Rails** and uses **Heroku**.
